Create a new project - in the project create:
A header file(.h) for the class using your class name to name the file
A source file (.cpp) for the class definitions using the class name 
A source file for your main() function
Design a class that has an array of floating-point numbers.  A constructor should accept an integer argument and dynamically allocate the array to hold that many numbers.  A destructor will free the memory held by the array. The class will have member functions to perform the following operations:
Store a number in any element of the array
Retrieve a number from any element of the array
Return the highest value stored in the array
Return the lowest value stored in the array
Return the average of all numbers stored in the array
Demonstrate the class in a main() program.
